# Kanboard - CompletedComplexity - Plugin
------------------

**Plugin to add analytics on the Complexity metric**

- *Add a Analytics CompletedComplexity on project Analytics sidebar*:

This works by measuring the amount of "Complexity" that has been moved into the "Done" column in weekly increments.

Install:
-------
* To install, download the repo into the kanboard plugins folder.
* Make sure the name of the folder is "CompletedComplexity".

How it works:
------------
1. Install plugin
2. Go Project Analytics to see new entries menus
3. You can edit start and end dates of your complexity tracking

TODO:
------------
* Work with boards that name their last column something other than "Done"
* Analyze complexity completion by user instead of entire board.
* Have a way to assign and count complexity of subtasks
